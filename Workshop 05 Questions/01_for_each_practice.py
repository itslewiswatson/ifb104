# For-each practice
#
# The most commonly used kind of repetition for our purposes
# is the FOR-EACH loop which does some action for every
# value in a list.  The actions can be made distinct by
# referring to the particular value.
#
# As practice in creating such loops, this exercise simply
# asks you to draw some patterns using Turtle graphics and
# the values in some lists by following simple instructions.
#

           'orange red', 'seashell', 'chocolate', 'light steel blue',

# Develop your code below by following the instructions.  Each step
# is independent of its predecessors so when you finish one step
# comment it out and start on the next.

# Step 1: For each of the colours above, set the pen colour accordingly
# add draw a dot of size 50.  So that the dots don't all appear on
# top of one another, move forward 15 pixels after drawing each one.

pass

# Step 2: Comment out your Step 1 code. Now, with the pen down,
# walk in a circle for each of the radii (plural of radius) in the
# list above to produce a tunnel-like pattern.  To make your
# pattern more interesting, turn the turtle left by 12 degrees
# after drawing each circle.  This will create a pattern like
# a snail's shell.

pass

# Step 3: Comment out your code for Steps 1 and 2 above.  Again
# with the pen down, tell the turtle to go to each of the
# coordinates in the list above.  This should produce a pattern
# reminiscent of a well-known car logo.  Make it appear even
# more realistic by making the pen colour red and filling in
# the image.
