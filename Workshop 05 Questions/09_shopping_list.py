#
# Shopping list
#
# Develop an interactive program which repeatedly prompts the
# user to enter a grocery item (as text) to be added to a shopping
# list.
#
# The procedure should stop when string 'stop' is entered,
# and a complete, alphabetically sorted list of grocery items
# should be then printed to the screen, one item per line.
#


#---------------------------------------------------------
#
# A suggested problem solving strategy:
#
# 1. Initialise a list variable to hold the shopping list
# 2. Get the first input from the user
# 3. As long as the user's input is not 'stop':
#    a. Add the item entered by the user to the shopping list
#    b. Get the next input from the user
# 4. Sort the shopping list
# 5. Print the shopping list, one item per line
