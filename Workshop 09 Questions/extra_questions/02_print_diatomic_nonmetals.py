#
# Print diatomic nonmetals
#
# In this exercise you will develop a Python program that
# accesses an SQLite database.  We assume that you have
# already loaded a version of the Elements database using
# the a graphical user interface.  You can do so by importing
# the elements.sql script provided.
#
# Your tasks:
#
# 1) Browse the database's contents in an interactive interface
# to ensure that you're familiar with its two tables and
# their columns.
#
# 2) Write a Python program to print both the names and symbols
# of the "diatomic nonmetals" in our small database.  These
# are the elements with atomic numbers 1, 7-9 and 17.
#



#---------------------------------------------------------

# Import the SQLite functions
from sqlite3 import *

## DEVELOP YOUR PROGRAM HERE BY REPLACING EACH OF THE 'pass'
## STATEMENTS BELOW (WHICH DO NOTHING) WITH THE NECESSARY CODE

# 1. Make a connection to the elements database
pass

# 2. Get a cursor on the database
pass

# 3. Construct the SQLite query
pass

# 4. Execute the query
pass

# 5. Get the result set and print it out
pass

# 6. Close the cursor and connection
pass
