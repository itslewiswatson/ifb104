# Volume of a cylinder
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following values have already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, denoting the measurements of a cylindrical
# tank:

radius = 4 # metres
height = 10 # metres

# Also assume that we have imported the existential constant "pi"
# from the "math" library module:

from math import pi

# Write an expression, or expressions, to calculate the volume
# of the tank.  Print the result in a message to the screen.  (If
# you've forgotten the formula for the area of a circle and hence
# volume of a cylinder, ask one of your workshop partners!)

volume = ((pi * radius) ** 2) * height
print("The volume of the tank is " + str(round(volume, 2)) + " cubic metres")
