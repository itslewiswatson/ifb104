# Eight Eights
#
# Here's a challenging little puzzle you can solve with the
# help of Python.  Can you devise a numeric expression in
# which the digit 8 appears exactly 8 times and which
# evaluates to 1000?  To check your answer, evaluate the
# expression in Python and print the result.  There are many
# different solutions to this problem, so see if the other
# groups in your class come up with different answers.

result = 888 + 88 + 8 + 8 + 8
print(result)

#--------------------
# Integer version: Solve the problem using only the digit 8
# and the integer arithmetic operators +, -, * and //.  (You
# don't have to use them all.)  The result should be the
# integer value 1000.

##### Put the code to evaluate and print your expression here

expr = 888 + (8 * 8) + (8 * 8) - (8 + 8)
print(expr)

#--------------------
# Floating point version: Solve the problem using only the
# digit 8, decimal points, floating point arithmetic (+, -,
# * and /), the square root function and the exponentiation
# operator **.  (Again you don't have to use them all.)  In
# this case the result should be the floating point
# value 1000.0, but remember that the rounding errors inherent
# in computer arithmetic might not produce a mathematically
# precise result!

from math import sqrt
##### Put the code to evaluate and print your expression here

fpoint = sqrt(8 ** 8) / ((8 + 8 + 8 + 8) / 8) - (8 + 8 + 8)
print(fpoint)
