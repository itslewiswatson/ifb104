# Pythagorean Theorem
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Recall from high-school geometry lessons Pythagoras' famous
# theorem about right-angled triangles:
#
#   "The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares
#    of the other two sides"
#
# Write an expression to calculate the length of a right-angled
# triangle's hypotenuse given the lengths of the other two sides.
# For instance, given the two lengths below the answer should
# equal 5.
#
# COMMENT: This is not especially hard, but we're not going to
# give you any hints.  In particular, you will need to find out
# for yourself how to express the required mathematical formula
# in Python.  It's important that you know where to find such
# information by yourself because your Workshop Facilitators will
# not always be on hand to assist you.

from math import sqrt

side_a = 3
side_b = 4

hypotenuse = sqrt((side_a ** 2) + (side_b ** 2))
print("The hypotenuse's length is equal to " + str(hypotenuse) + " units")

# JUST FOR FUN
#
# In the classic MGM movie version of the "Wizard of Oz" we
# meet the Cowardly Lion who wants courage, the Tin Woodsman
# who wants a heart, the Scarecrow who wants a brain and, of
# course, young Dorothy who just wants to go home.  At the
# movie's end the Wizard gives the Scarecrow a diploma
# representing knowledge.  To demonstrate his new-found
# intelligence, the Scarecrow rapidly (mis)quotes the
# Pythagorean Theorem as follows:
#
#   "The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an
#    isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the
#    remaining side"
#
# Ever since the movie was released in 1939 film historians
# have speculated about why the Scarecrow got the theorem
# so wrong.  (An isosceles triangle is one with two sides
# having the same length.  It's easy to show by counterexample
# that the Scarecrow's theorem is incorrect.  Try it.)
#
# Was this a simple blunder on the part of the scriptwriters?
# Or was it a subtle way of pointing out that the Scarecrow,
# although now happy, isn't any smarter than he was before?
# No one knows!  (You can find various copies of this scene
# on YouTube.)
