#
# Yahtzee
#
# In the game "Yahtzee" five dice are rolled and if all
# five have the same value the player scores 50, but
# otherwise zero.
#
# Define a function with five integer parameters, each
# representing a die's face value (i.e., between 1 and 6).
# The function should return 50 if all the supplied
# arguments are the same value, otherwise it should
# return 0.
#
# Trivia: The singular of "dice" is "die".
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.
#


#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
