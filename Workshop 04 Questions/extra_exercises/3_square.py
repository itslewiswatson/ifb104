# Is the number a square?
#
# Define a Boolean function with one parameter, a number,
# which determines if that number is a square of an integer.
# A Boolean function is one which returns True or False
# - also called a 'predicate'.
#
# Hints: A given number is the square of an integer if
# its square root is a whole number.  A whole number is
# one which has no remainder when divided by 1.
#
# Warning: Remember that negative numbers don't have a
# square root!
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.
#


#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
