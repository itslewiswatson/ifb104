# Weather Warning
#
# Define a function which accepts one argument, a number
# representing a temperature in Celsius.
# The function should return warnings about extreme
# temperatures.
#
# Warnings should be issued for temperatures as follows:
#   above 40          = 'Extreme heat caution!'
#   between 30 and 40 = 'Warm weather'
#   between 10 and 20 = 'Cool weather'
#   below 10          = 'Extreme cold caution!'
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.
#


#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
