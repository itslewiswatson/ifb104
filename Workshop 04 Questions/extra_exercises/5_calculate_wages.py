#
# Calculate Wages
#
# As an example of a numerical calculation that includes
# a condition, define a function to calculate and return
# the weekly wages to be paid to an employee. The function
# should have two parameters:
#
# 1)  a number representing the total number of hours worked;
#     and
# 2)  a number representing the hourly rate of pay.
#
# Apart from the amount paid for a "normal" week's work,
# there are two special conditions applicable:
#
# a) a penalty rate of time and a half (i.e., one and a half times
#    the normal hourly rate) is payable for hours worked in
#    excess of 40; and
# b) a weekly bonus of $50 is also payable if the number
#    of hours worked exceeds 50.
#
# The result should be returned as a floating point number.
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.
#


#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
