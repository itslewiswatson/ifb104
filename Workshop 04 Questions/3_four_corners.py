# Four corners
#
# As a graphics program that involves making decisions, this
# exercise extends the demonstration program from the lecture
# with colour.
#
# The program below is a minor variant of the "jump to the left"
# Turtle graphics demonstration from Lecture 4.  The
# main difference is that a thick line is drawn as the cursor
# moves around the screen.
#
# Your task is to modify the program so that the line changes
# colour depending on what quadrant of the screen the cursor is in.
# We assume the drawing surface is divided into four segments as
# follows, with coordinate (0, 0) at the centre.
#
#                   |
#    Quadrant 1     |    Quadrant 2
#                   |
#                   |
#    ---------------+---------------
#                   |
#    Quadrant 3     |    Quadrant 4
#                   |
#                   |
#
# Select a colour for each quadrant and extend the code below
# so that the line being drawn changes colour depending on the
# quadrant.  The result will be an abstract painting with
# four differently coloured squares.
#
# Hint: The cursor's current coordinates are returned by
# Turtle's "xcor" and "ycor" methods.
#
