# Leap Years
#
# Leap years are used to account for the fact that the
# astronomical year, the time it takes the Earth to orbit
# the Sun once, is not exactly synchronised with the
# standard calendar year of 365 days.  Roughly speaking
# we experience a leap year of 366 days every four years,
# but in fact the rules governing leap years are more
# complex than that.  To decide whether or not a given
# year is a leap year or not, we therefore need to use
# one or more conditional statements (or expressions).
#
# Below are some tests for a Boolean-valued function
# (or "predicate") which returns True if a given year
# is a leap year and False otherwise.  Your task is
# to write the function that does this.
#
# Normally a leap year is a year which is evenly
# divisible by 4.  However, if it is also divisible
# by 100, then it must also be divisible by 400 to
# be a leap year.
#
# For instance: 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300,
# 2500, 2600 are NOT leap years but 1600, 2000, 2400
# ARE leap years.
#
# Hint: A number X is evenly divisible by another number Y
# if X % Y == 0, i.e., if the remainder after integer
# division is zero.
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.
#


#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
