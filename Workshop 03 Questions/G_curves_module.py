# "Curves" module
#
# In this file you will define a function which draws a
# single curved shape on the screen, starting from the
# "home" coordinate, at a given angle and with a certain
# radius.  This function will be imported into,
# and called by, the "main" Curves program.

from turtle import *

# Define a Turtle graphics function which has two
# parameters, a heading (in degrees) and a radius (in
# pixels).  When called the function should:
#
# 1. go to the home position,
# 2. set the turtle's heading to the given angle,
# 3. walk part of a circle, and
# 4. return to the home position.
#
# Initially, try setting the "extent" of the circle
# walked to 70 degrees.  (You can vary this later to
# get different effects.)
