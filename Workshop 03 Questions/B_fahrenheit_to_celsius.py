# Temperature Conversion
#
# Define a function with one parameter, a number representing
# a temperature in Fahrenheit, that returns that temperature
# in Celsius.  In general the relationship between a temperature
# in Celsius C and the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit F
# is C = (F - 32) * (5 / 9).
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
#
# NB: For accuracy you should do the calculation using
# floating point arithmetic.  However, the tests show that
# we want the result as an integer (a whole number).
# Having calculated the answer as a floating point number
# you should therefore use the built-in "round" function
# to round the answer off to a whole number before
# returning it.
#
# Observation: This exercise takes us into the dangerous
# and complex territory of floating point arithmetic,
# where different answers may be produced by computers with
# different architectures, e.g., 32-bit versus 64-bit
# arithmetic.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.


#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
