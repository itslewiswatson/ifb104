# Median
#
# The median of a set of values is a measure of central
# tendency like the average, but has the advantage of
# being less affected by outliers.  Define a function
# with one parameter, a non-empty list, which returns
# the median item in that list.
#
# For the purpose of this exercise, the median item is
# the middle value when the list is arranged in ascending
# order.
#
# (Comment: In fact, the mathematical definition of a
# "median" is the middle value when the given list has an
# odd length, but is the average of the two values in the
# middle when the list contains an even number of items.
# We ignore this fine distinction here.  All of the lists
# in our test suite contain an odd number of items,
# which makes the problem easier to solve.)
#
# The tests below tell us how your function is expected to
# behave when called.  After you've written your function,
# confirm that it works correctly by (a) running this module
# so that your function is defined and then (b) copying
# each of the function calls in the set of tests into the
# shell to see if the right answer is returned.  Obviously
# if you don't get the expected answers then you'll need
# to modify your code until you do.
# 
# Finally, the main program of this file runs the tests
# automatically.  The code is commented out, but if you
# want to run all the tests automatically, just uncomment
# the code and run this file.  Of course, you should pass
# all the tests in order to complete this exercise.
 

#---------------------------------------------------------
# These are the tests your function must pass.
