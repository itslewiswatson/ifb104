## Bouncing Ball
##
## Just as printing "Hello World" is the standard first
## example completed in a new programming language, games
## packages are usually introduced with a "Bouncing Ball"
## demonstration in which a ball bounces around
## the screen.  Turtle graphics is not designed for
## creating games, but we can still produce a convincing
## bouncing ball simulation.
##
## The incomplete program below creates a black window and
## makes the cursor look like a beachball.  (Make sure the
## file 'beachball.gif' is in the same folder as this
## program.)
##
## Your job is to make the ball bounce realistically around
## the walls.  Use the following strategy.
##
## 1. Set up the window size to a known value so that you
##    know the maximum x and y coordinates (i.e., where the
##    borders are)
## 2. Lift the pen, because we don't want to leave a trail
## 3. For each of a large range of "bounces":
##    a. Choose a random position on the top border
##    b. Move the cursor to that position
##    c. Choose a random position on the left border
##    d. Move the cursor to that position
##    e. Choose a random position on the bottom border
##    f. Move the cursor to that position
##    g. Choose a random position on the right border
##    h. Move the cursor to that position
##
## Experiment with different ways of choosing the random
## positions to get the most realistic bouncing effect.
## (We found that it's best to keep the ball away from
## the corners.)
